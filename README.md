# Temporal Dynamics of On- and Off-Responses in Auditory Cortex during Gap Detection: A Population Analysis and Modeling Approach

The content in this repo contains the code of my undergraduate thesis started at September 2024.

[data.py](Code/Function/data.py) contains some primary data analysis, including spike train extraction, primary auditory unit selection, computation of mean firing rate across trials with same conditions etc. 

[subspace_analysis.py](Code/Function/subspace_analysis.py) contains the code for analyzing and plotting
the result of comparing population subspace. [DisplaySubspaceAnalysis.py](Code/Function/DisplaySubspaceAnalysis.py) is the script used to run and display all plots related.

[projection_analysis.py](Code/Function/projection_analysis.py) contains the code for analyzing and plotting
the result of comparing neural data projections to the population subspace. [DisplayProjectionAnalysis.py](Code/Function/DisplayProjectionAnalysis.py) is the script used to run and display all plots related.
