The content in this repo contains the code of my undergraduate thesis started at September 2024.

[neuron.py](Code/Function/neuron.py) contains data analysis on original spike train data.

[result.py](Code/Function/result.py) contains plotting and some further analysis on the processed data.

[Display.py](Code/Display.py) is the script used to display all plots.
